        - Dedicated classes of eight primitives.
        - Presented in "java.lang" package.
        - Used to wrap the primitive data type into
          an object of that class.

          Autoboxing vs Unboxing
        - Autoboxing converts primitives into wrapper class objects.
        - Unboxing converts wrapper class objects into primitives.
